# SUNO AI Prompt - Anthem of Time Part 2 & Finale

## Song Context
This is a continuation of "Anthem of Time" for the MagnumOpus Terraria mod. The song accompanies the FATE boss fight - a celestial being who guards the universal melodies. Part 1 established the confrontation; Part 2 builds toward the climactic battle, and the Finale represents either victory or the hero's defiant last stand.

## Technical Production Notes for SUNO

**Vocal Processing:**
- Female: Heavy reverb, layered harmonies, soprano range
- Male: Gritty midrange, slight distortion, powerful chest voice
- Choir: Cathedral reverb, wide stereo spread

**Mix Balance:**
- Drums/808: Foundation, punchy but not overwhelming
- Orchestra: Full but leaving room for vocals
- Vocals: Front and center, clear articulation
- Brass: Accent hits, not constant

**Reference Feel:**
Imagine if Two Steps From Hell collaborated with a phonk producer - epic orchestral grandeur meets modern bass-heavy production, with operatic vocals cutting through.

## Usage in MagnumOpus

- **Part 2** plays during Fate's True Form awakening and the second phase of the fight
- **Finale** plays during the final 20% HP phase (Cosmic Wrath) and death animation
- The choir breakdown in Part 2 should sync with the moment when Fate declares "I WILL NOT LET YOU CONDUCT THE FINAL MOVEMENT!"
- The triumphant resolution in the Finale plays as the four Revolutionary Melodies are released upon Fate's defeat
