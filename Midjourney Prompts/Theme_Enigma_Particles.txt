# Enigma Variations - Particles and Effects

## Theme Overview

Enigma Variations theme represents mystery, the unknown, arcane puzzles, and unanswered questions. Visual motifs include:
- **Question marks** - floating, rotating, dissolving
- **Mystery symbols** - riddles, puzzles, unknown glyphs
- **Void swirls** - dark spiraling vortexes
- **Arcane glyphs** - indecipherable ancient writing
- **Eye symbols** - all-seeing eyes, mysterious gazes
- **Puzzle pieces** - fragmenting, assembling
- **Paradox effects** - impossible geometry, recursive patterns

## Implementation Notes

When tinting these particles in code, use the Enigma color gradient:
```csharp
// Enigma gradient: Black → Purple → Green
Color GetEnigmaGradient(float progress)
{
    if (progress < 0.5f)
        return Color.Lerp(EnigmaBlack, EnigmaPurple, progress * 2f);
    else
        return Color.Lerp(EnigmaPurple, EnigmaGreenFlame, (progress - 0.5f) * 2f);
}
```

Combine multiple particle types for complex effects:
- Question marks + void swirls for Paradox attacks
- Eyes + mist for mystery zone effects
- Glyphs + green flames for arcane damage
- Puzzle pieces + impacts for revelation effects
