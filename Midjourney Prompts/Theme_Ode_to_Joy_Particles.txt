## Implementation Notes

When tinting these particles in code, use the Ode to Joy gradient:
```csharp
// Ode to Joy gradient: Rose Red → Petal Pink → White (for petals)
Color GetPetalGradient(float progress)
{
    if (progress < 0.5f)
        return Color.Lerp(OdeRoseRed, OdePetalPink, progress * 2f);
    else
        return Color.Lerp(OdePetalPink, OdeWhite, (progress - 0.5f) * 2f);
}

// For vines and leaves:
Color GetVineGradient(float progress)
{
    return Color.Lerp(OdeVineGreen, OdeLeafGreen, progress);
}

// For pollen accents:
Color pollenColor = Color.Lerp(OdeGold, OdeWhite, 0.3f);
```

Combine multiple particle types for botanical effects:
- Petals + leaves for romantic scatter
- Vines + thorns for attack/defense
- Pollen + seeds for healing spread
- Full bloom + burst for ultimate effects
