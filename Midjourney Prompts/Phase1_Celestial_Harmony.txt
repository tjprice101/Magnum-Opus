# PHASE 1: CELESTIAL HARMONY - Pristine Cosmic White Metal Transformations

## Overview

These prompts are designed to take ANY existing weapon or accessory image and transform it into a **PRISTINE COSMICALLY NEON WHITE METAL VARIANT** of itself. The transformation preserves the original item's silhouette and recognizable design while completely reimagining it as:

- **Pristine Neon White Metal** - Luminous, divine white metal with cosmic energy bleeding through
- **Amorphous Cosmic Energy** - Reality-bending entropic glow radiating from within
- **Theme Effects Preserved** - Original theme's fire/petals/feathers/etc. transformed into cosmic versions
- **Divine Musical Resonance** - Visible harmonic waves and musical notation in the energy aura
- **High Resolution** - 256x256 pixel art minimum, optimized for detailed Terraria sprites

These prompts work with image-to-image (img2img) workflows in Midjourney v7.0+

# USAGE NOTES

1. **Image Weight (--iw)**: Set to 2.0 to preserve original weapon silhouette while allowing pristine white metal transformation
2. **Stylize (--s)**: Set to 750 for optimal balance between prompt adherence and artistic interpretation
3. **Resolution**: All prompts optimized for 256x256 pixel art minimum - for higher resolution add `--ar 1:1 --quality 2` or specify `512x512 pixel art sprite`
4. **Version**: Midjourney v7.0 required for best white metal luminosity results
5. **Process**: Upload original weapon image → use /imagine with prompt → add image URL at start of prompt
6. **White Metal Priority**: The pristine neon white metal is the PRIMARY visual - theme colors should bleed subtly at edges only
7. **Iteration**: May need 2-3 generations to achieve optimal pristine white metal balance with theme effects
8. **Theme Preservation**: Original weapon's fire/petals/feathers/effects become COSMIC WHITE VERSIONS with theme color hints
