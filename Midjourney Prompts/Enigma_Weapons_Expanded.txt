# Enigma Variations - Expanded Weapon Design Prompts

## Theme Reference
```
EnigmaBlack       - (15, 10, 20)   - Primary void darkness

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
# ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

## Prompt Modifiers
- `--s 750` - Standard stylization for consistent Enigma aesthetic
- `--v 7.0` - Midjourney v7 for best detail rendering
- Add `--ar 1:1` for square sprites if needed
- Add `--quality 2` for higher resolution final renders

## Color Application
When tinting/coloring generated white sprites:
```csharp
// Base metal coloring
Color enigmaMetalPurple = new Color(100, 40, 140);
Color enigmaAccentVoid = new Color(15, 10, 20);
Color enigmaEnergyGreen = new Color(50, 220, 100);

// Gradient application
Color GetEnigmaGradient(float t) 
{
    if (t < 0.5f)
        return Color.Lerp(enigmaAccentVoid, enigmaMetalPurple, t * 2f);
    return Color.Lerp(enigmaMetalPurple, enigmaEnergyGreen, (t - 0.5f) * 2f);
}
```

## VFX Pairing
Each weapon should have corresponding VFX:
- Question mark particles on swing/fire
- Watching eye particles on impact
- Green flame trails on projectiles
- Arcane glyph bursts on critical effects
- Mystery mist ambient on hold
