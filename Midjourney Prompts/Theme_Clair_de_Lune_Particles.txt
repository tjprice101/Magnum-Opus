## Implementation Notes

When tinting these particles in code, use the Clair de Lune gradient:
```csharp
// Clair de Lune gradient: Night Mist → Soft Blue → Pearl
Color GetClairGradient(float progress)
{
    if (progress < 0.5f)
        return Color.Lerp(ClairNightMist, ClairSoftBlue, progress * 2f);
    else
        return Color.Lerp(ClairSoftBlue, ClairPearl, (progress - 0.5f) * 2f);
}

// For mechanical brass accents:
Color GetBrassAccent(float intensity)
{
    return Color.Lerp(ClairSilver, ClairBrass, intensity);
}
```

Combine multiple particle types for clockwork effects:
- Gears + springs for mechanical impacts
- Clock faces + pendulums for time abilities
- Moon phases + hourglasses for duration effects
- Debris + bursts for destruction effects
