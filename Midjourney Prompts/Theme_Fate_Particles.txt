## Implementation Notes

When tinting these particles in code, use the Fate cosmic gradient:
```csharp
// Fate gradient: White → Dark Pink → Purple → Crimson
Color GetFateGradient(float progress)
{
    if (progress < 0.33f)
        return Color.Lerp(FateWhite, FateDarkPink, progress * 3f);
    else if (progress < 0.66f)
        return Color.Lerp(FateDarkPink, FatePurple, (progress - 0.33f) * 3f);
    else
        return Color.Lerp(FatePurple, FateCrimson, (progress - 0.66f) * 3f);
}
```

**FATE SPECIAL REQUIREMENT - Screen Distortions:**
Fate effects MUST include reality-distorting visuals:
- Chromatic aberration (RGB separation)
- Screen slice effects
- Reality tear overlays
- Temporal echo trails

Combine multiple particle types for endgame spectacle:
- Planets + galaxies for cosmic explosions
- Constellations + fate threads for destiny abilities
- Black holes + reality tears for void attacks
- Stars + nebulae for area effects
