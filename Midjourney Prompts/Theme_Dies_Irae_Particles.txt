## Implementation Notes

When tinting these particles in code, use the Dies Irae gradient:
```csharp
// Dies Irae gradient: Black → Deep Red → Hellfire → Ember
Color GetDiresGradient(float progress)
{
    if (progress < 0.33f)
        return Color.Lerp(DiresBlack, DiresDeepRed, progress * 3f);
    else if (progress < 0.66f)
        return Color.Lerp(DiresDeepRed, DiresHellfire, (progress - 0.33f) * 3f);
    else
        return Color.Lerp(DiresHellfire, DiresEmber, (progress - 0.66f) * 3f);
}

// For brimstone/sulfur accents:
Color brimstoneColor = Color.Lerp(DiresBrimstone, DiresHellfire, intensity);

// For ash and smoke (inverted - dark particles):
Color ashColor = Color.Lerp(DiresAsh, DiresBlack, progress);

// For unholy violet accents:
Color unholyColor = Color.Lerp(DiresViolet, DiresDeepRed, progress);
```

**Dies Irae Special Techniques:**
- Use dark smoke tinting (ash gray to black) unlike other themes
- Chains should have metallic sheen via lighting
- Combine fire + chains for signature infernal look
- Skulls add death/judgment flavor sparingly

Combine multiple particle types for infernal effects:
- Chains + hellfire for binding damage
- Skulls + brimstone for death curse
- Cracks + fire for ground eruption
- Smoke + ash for aftermath effects
